<h2><a name="EDITORS_NOTE" id="EDITORS_NOTE"></a>EDITOR'S NOTE.</h2>


<p>In this edition of Herrick quotation is for the first time facilitated
by the poems being numbered according to their order in the original
edition. This numbering has rendered it possible to print those
Epigrams, which successive editors have joined in deploring, in a
detachable Appendix, their place in the original being indicated by the
numeration. It remains to be added that the footnotes in this edition
are intended to explain, as unobtrusively as possible, difficulties of
phrase or allusion which might conceivably hinder the understanding of
Herrick's meaning. In the longer Notes at the end of each volume earlier
versions of some important poems are printed from manuscripts at the
British Museum, and an endeavour has been made to extend the list of
Herrick's debts to classical sources, and to identify some of his
friends who have hitherto escaped research. An editor is always apt to
mention his predecessors rather for blame than praise, and I therefore
take this opportunity of acknowledging my general indebtedness to the
pioneer work of Mr. Hazlitt and Dr. Grosart, upon whose foundations all
editors of Herrick must necessarily build.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>It is singular that the first great age of English lyric poetry should
have been also the one great age of English dramatic poetry: but it is
hardly less singular that the lyric school should have advanced as
steadily as the dramatic school declined from the promise of its dawn.
Born with Marlowe, it rose at once with Shakespeare to heights
inaccessible before and since and for ever, to sink through bright
gradations of glorious decline to its final and beautiful sunset in
Shirley: but the lyrical record that begins with the author of "Euphues"
and "Endymion" grows fuller if not brighter through a whole chain of
constellations till it culminates in the crowning star of Herrick.
Shakespeare's last song, the exquisite and magnificent overture to "The
Two Noble Kinsmen," is hardly so limpid in its flow, so liquid in its
melody, as the two great songs in "Valentinian": but Herrick, our last
poet of that incomparable age or generation, has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> matched them again and
again. As a creative and inventive singer, he surpasses all his rivals
in quantity of good work; in quality of spontaneous instinct and
melodious inspiration he reminds us, by frequent and flawless evidence,
who above all others must beyond all doubt have been his first master
and his first model in lyric poetry&mdash;the author of "The Passionate
Shepherd to his Love".</p>

<p>The last of his line, he is and will probably be always the first in
rank and station of English song-writers. We have only to remember how
rare it is to find a perfect song, good to read and good to sing,
combining the merits of Coleridge and Shelley with the capabilities of
Tommy Moore and Haynes Bayly, to appreciate the unique and
unapproachable excellence of Herrick. The lyrist who wished to be a
butterfly, the lyrist who fled or flew to a lone vale at the hour
(whatever hour it may be) "when stars are weeping," have left behind
them such stuff as may be sung, but certainly cannot be read and endured
by any one with an ear for verse. The author of the Ode on France and
the author of the Ode to the West Wind have left us hardly more than a
song a-piece which has been found fit for setting to music: and, lovely
as they are, the fame of their authors does not mainly depend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span> on the
song of Glycine or the song of which Leigh Hunt so justly and so
critically said that Beaumont and Fletcher never wrote anything of the
kind more lovely. Herrick, of course, lives simply by virtue of his
songs; his more ambitious or pretentious lyrics are merely magnified and
prolonged and elaborated songs. Elegy or litany, epicede or
epithalamium, his work is always a song-writer's; nothing more, but
nothing less, than the work of the greatest song-writer&mdash;as surely as
Shakespeare is the greatest dramatist&mdash;ever born of English race. The
apparent or external variety of his versification is, I should suppose,
incomparable; but by some happy tact or instinct he was too naturally
unambitious to attempt, like Jonson, a flight in the wake of Pindar. He
knew what he could not do: a rare and invaluable gift. Born a blackbird
or a thrush, he did not take himself (or try) to be a nightingale.</p>

<p>It has often been objected that he did mistake himself for a sacred
poet: and it cannot be denied that his sacred verse at its worst is as
offensive as his secular verse at its worst; nor can it be denied that
no severer sentence of condemnation can be passed upon any poet's work.
But neither Herbert nor Crashaw could have bettered such a divinely
beautiful triplet as this:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We see Him come, and know Him ours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who with His sunshine and His showers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turns all the patient ground to flowers".<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That is worthy of Miss Rossetti herself: and praise of such work can go
no higher.</p>

<p>But even such exquisite touches or tones of colour may be too often
repeated in fainter shades or more glaring notes of assiduous and facile
reiteration. The sturdy student who tackles his Herrick as a schoolboy
is expected to tackle his Horace, in a spirit of pertinacious and stolid
straightforwardness, will probably find himself before long so nauseated
by the incessant inhalation of spices and flowers, condiments and
kisses, that if a musk-rat had run over the page it could hardly be less
endurable to the physical than it is to the spiritual stomach. The
fantastic and the brutal blemishes which deform and deface the
loveliness of his incomparable genius are hardly so damaging to his fame
as his general monotony of matter and of manner. It was doubtless in
order to relieve this saccharine and "mellisonant" monotony that he
thought fit to intersperse these interminable droppings of natural or
artificial perfume with others of the rankest and most intolerable
odour: but a diet of alternate sweetmeats and emetics is for the average
of eaters and drinkers no less unpalatable than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span> unwholesome. It is
useless and thankless to enlarge on such faults or such defects, as it
would be useless and senseless to ignore. But how to enlarge, to
expatiate, to insist on the charm of Herrick at his best&mdash;a charm so
incomparable and so inimitable that even English poetry can boast of
nothing quite like it or worthy to be named after it&mdash;the most
appreciative reader will be the slowest to affirm or imagine that he can
conjecture. This, however, he will hardly fail to remark: that Herrick,
like most if not all other lyric poets, is not best known by his best
work. If we may judge by frequency of quotation or of reference, the
ballad of the ride from Ghent to Aix is a far more popular, more
generally admired and accredited specimen of Mr. Browning's work than
"The Last Ride Together"&mdash;and "The Lost Leader" than "The Lost
Mistress". Yet the superiority of the less-popular poem is in either
case beyond all question or comparison: in depth and in glow of spirit
and of harmony, in truth and charm of thought and word, undeniable and
indescribable. No two men of genius were ever more unlike than the
authors of "Paracelsus" and "Hesperides": and yet it is as true of
Herrick as of Browning that his best is not always his best-known work.
Everyone knows the song, "Gather ye rosebuds while ye<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span> may"; few, I
fear, by comparison, know the yet sweeter and better song, "Ye have been
fresh and green". The general monotony of style and motive which
fatigues and irritates his too-persevering reader is here and there
relieved by a change of key which anticipates the note of a later and
very different lyric school. The brilliant simplicity and pointed grace
of the three stanzas to &#338;none ("What conscience, say, is it in thee")
recall the lyrists of the Restoration in their cleanlier and happier
mood. And in the very fine epigram headed by the words "Devotion makes
the Deity" he has expressed for once a really high and deep thought in
words of really noble and severe propriety. His "Mad Maid's Song,"
again, can only be compared with Blake's; which has more of passionate
imagination, if less of pathetic sincerity.</p>

<h2><a name="LIFE_OF_HERRICK" id="LIFE_OF_HERRICK"></a>LIFE OF HERRICK.</h2>


<p>Of the lives of many poets we know too much; of some few too little.
Lovers of Herrick are almost ideally fortunate. Just such a bare outline
of his life has come down to us as is sufficient to explain the
allusions in his poems, and, on the other hand, there is no temptation
to substitute chatter about his relations with Julia and Dianeme for
enjoyment of his delightful verse. The recital of the bare outline need
detain us but a few minutes: only the least imaginative of readers will
have any difficulty in filling it in from the poems themselves.</p>

<p>From early in the fourteenth century onwards we hear of the family of
Eyrick or Herrick at Stretton, in Leicestershire. At the beginning of
the sixteenth century we find a branch of it settled in Leicester
itself, where John Eyrick, the poet's grandfather, was admitted a
freeman in 1535, and afterwards acted as Mayor. This John's second son,
Nicholas, migrated to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span> London, became a goldsmith in Wood Street,
Cheapside, and, according to a licence issued by the Bishop of London,
December 8, 1582, married Julian, daughter of William Stone, sister of
Anne, wife of Sir Stephen Soame, Lord Mayor of London in 1598. The
marriage was not unfruitful. A William<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Herrick was baptized at St.
Vedast's, Foster Lane, November 24, 1585; Martha, January 22, 1586;
Mercy, December 22, 1586; Thomas, May 7, 1588; Nicholas, April 22, 1589;
Anne, July 26, 1590; and Robert himself, August 24, 1591.</p>

<p>Fifteen months after the poet's birth, on November 7, 1592, Nicholas
Herrick made his will, estimating his property as worth &pound;3000, and
devising it, as to one-third to his wife, and as to the other two-thirds
to his children in equal shares. In the will he described himself as "of
perfect memorye in sowle, but sicke in bodye". Two days after its
execution he was buried, having died, not from disease, but from a fall
from an upper window. His death had so much the appearance of
self-destruction that &pound;220 had to be paid to the High Almoner, Dr.
Fletcher, Bishop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span> of Bristol, in satisfaction of his official claim to
the goods and chattels of suicides. Herrick's biographers have not
failed to vituperate the Bishop for his avarice, but dues allowed by law
are hardly to be abandoned because a baby of fifteen months is destined
to become a brilliant poet, and no other exceptional circumstances are
alleged. The estate of Nicholas Herrick could the better afford the fine
inasmuch as it realized &pound;2000 more than was expected.</p>

<p>By the will Robert and William Herrick were appointed "overseers," or
trustees for the children. The former was the poet's godfather, and in
his will of 1617 left him &pound;5. To William Herrick, then recently knighted
for his services as goldsmith, jeweller, and moneylender to James I.,
the young Robert was apprenticed for ten years, September 25, 1607. An
allusion to "beloved Westminster," in his <i>Tears to Thamesis</i>, has been
taken to refer to Westminster school, and alleged as proof that he was
educated there. Dr. Grosart even presses the mention of Richmond,
Kingston, and Hampton Court to support a conjecture that Herrick may
have travelled up and down to school from Hampton. If so, one wonders
what his headmaster had to say to the "soft-smooth virgins, for our
chaste disport"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span> by whom he was accompanied. But the references in the
poem are surely to his courtier-life in London, and after his father's
death the apprenticeship to his uncle in 1607 is the first fact in his
life of which we can be sure.</p>

<p>In 1607, Herrick was fifteen, and, even if we conjecture that he may
have been allowed to remain at school some little time after his
apprenticeship nominally began, he must have served his uncle for five
or six years. Sir William had himself been bound apprentice in a similar
way to the poet's father, and we have no evidence that he exacted any
premium. At any rate, when in 1614, his nephew, then of age, desired to
leave the business and go to Cambridge, the ten years' apprenticeship
did not stand in his way, and he entered as a Fellow Commoner at St.
John's. His uncle plainly still managed his affairs, for an amusing
series of fourteen letters has been preserved at Beaumanor, until lately
the seat of Sir William's descendants, in which the poet asks sometimes
for payment of a quarterly stipend of &pound;10, sometimes for a formal loan,
sometimes for the help of his avuncular M&aelig;cenas. It seems a fair
inference from this variety of requests that, since Herrick's share of
his father's property could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span> hardly have yielded a yearly income of &pound;40,
he was allowed to draw on his capital for this sum, but that his uncle
and Lady Herrick occasionally made him small presents, which may account
for his tone of dependence.</p>

<p>The quarterly stipend was paid through various booksellers, but
irregularly, so that the poor poet was frequently reduced to great
straits, though &pound;40 a-year (&pound;200 of our money) was no bad allowance.
After two years he migrated from St. John's to Trinity Hall, to study
law and curtail his expenses. He took his Bachelor's degree from there
in January, 1617, and his Master's in 1620. The fourteen letters show
that he had prepared himself for University life by cultivating a very
florid prose style which frequently runs into decasyllabics, perhaps a
result of a study of the dramatists. Sir William Herrick is sometimes
addressed in them as his most "careful" uncle, but at the time of his
migration the poet speaks of his "ebbing estate," and as late as 1629 he
was still &pound;10 16s. 9d. in debt to the College Steward. We can thus
hardly imagine that he was possessed of any considerable private income
when he returned to London, to live practically on his wits, and a study
of his poems suggests that, the influence of the careful uncle removed,
whatever capital he possessed was soon likely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span> to vanish.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> His verses
to the Earl of Pembroke, to Endymion Porter and to others, show that he
was glad of "pay" as well as "praise," but the system of patronage
brought no discredit with it, and though the absence of any poetical
mention of his uncle suggests that the rich goldsmith was not
well-pleased with his nephew, with the rest of his well-to-do relations
Herrick seems to have remained on excellent terms.</p>

<p>Besides patrons, such as Pembroke, Westmoreland, Newark, Buckingham,
Herrick had less distinguished friends at Court, Edward Norgate, Jack
Crofts and others. He composed the words for two New Year anthems which
were set to music by Henry Lawes, and he was probably personally known
both to the King and Queen. Outside the Court he reckoned himself one of
Ben Jonson's disciples, "Sons of Ben" as they were called, had friends
at the Inns of Court, knew the organist of Westminster Abbey and his
pretty daughters, and had every temptation to live an amusing and
expensive life. His poems were handed about in manuscript after the
fashion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span> of the time, and wherever music and poetry were loved he was
sure to be a welcome guest.</p>

<p>Mr. Hazlitt's conjecture that Herrick at this time may have held some
small post in the Chapel at Whitehall is not unreasonable, but at what
date he took Holy Orders is not known. In 1627 he obtained the post of
chaplain to the unlucky expedition to the Isle of Rh&eacute;, and two years
later (September 30, 1629) he was presented by the King to the Vicarage
of Dean Prior, in Devonshire, which the promotion of its previous
incumbent, Dr. Potter, to the Bishopric of Carlisle, had left in the
royal gift. The annual value of the living was only &pound;50 (&pound;250 present
value), no great prize, but the poem entitled <i>Mr. Robert Hericke: his
farwell unto Poetrie</i> (not printed in <i>Hesperides</i>, but extant in more
than one manuscript version) shows that the poet was not unaware of the
responsibilities of his profession. "But unto me," he says to his Muse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But unto me be only hoarse, since now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Heaven and my soul bear record of my vow)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I my desires screw from thee and direct<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Them and my thoughts to that sublime respect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And conscience unto priesthood. 'Tis not need<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The scarecrow unto mankind) that doth breed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wiser conclusions in me, since I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've more to bear my charge than way to go;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Or had I not, I'd stop the spreading itch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of craving more: so in conceit be rich;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But 'tis the God of nature who intends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shapes my function for more glorious ends."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Perhaps it was at this time too that Herrick wrote his <i>Farewell to
Sack</i>, and although he returned both to sack and to poetry we should be
wrong in imagining him as a "blind mouth," using his office merely as a
means of gain. He celebrated the births of Charles II and his brother in
verse, perhaps with an eye to future royal favours, but no more than
Chaucer's good parson does he seem to have "run to London unto Seynte
Poules" in search of the seventeenth century equivalent for a chauntry,
and many of his poems show him living the life of a contented country
clergyman, sharing the contents of bin and cruse with his poor
parishioners, and jotting down sermon-notes in verse.</p>

<p>The great majority of Herrick's poems cannot be dated, and it is idle to
enquire which were written before his ordination and which afterwards.
His conception of religion was medieval in its sensuousness, and he
probably repeated the stages of sin, repentance and renewed assurance
with some facility. He lived with an old servant, Prudence Baldwin, the
"Prew" of many of his poems; kept a spaniel named Tracy, and, so says
tradition, a tame pig.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span> When his parishioners annoyed him he seems to
have comforted himself with epigrams on them; when they slumbered during
one of his sermons the manuscript was suddenly hurled at them with a
curse for their inattention.</p>

<p>In the same year that Herrick was appointed to his country vicarage his
mother died while living with her daughter, Mercy, the poet's dearest
sister (see <a href="ii.html#p818">818</a>), then for some time married to John Wingfield of
Brantham in Suffolk (see <a href="ii.html#p590">590</a>), by whom she had three sons and a
daughter, also called Mercy. His eldest brother, Thomas, had been placed
with a Mr. Massam, a merchant, but as early as 1610 had retired to live
a country life in Leicestershire (see <a href="#p106">106</a>). He appears to have married a
wife named Elizabeth, whose loss Herrick laments (see <a href="#p72">72</a>). Nicholas, the
next brother was more adventurous. He had become a merchant trading to
the Levant, and in this capacity had visited the Holy Land (see <a href="ii.html#p1100">1100</a>).
To his wife Susanna, daughter of William Salter, Herrick addresses two
poems (<a href="#p522">522</a> and <a href="ii.html#p977">977</a>). There were three sons and four daughters in this
family, and Herrick wrote a poem to one of the daughters, Bridget (<a href="#p562">562</a>),
and an elegy on another, Elizabeth (<a href="#p376">376</a>). When Mrs. Herrick died the
bulk of her property was left to the Wingfields, but William Herrick
received a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span> legacy of &pound;100, with ten pounds apiece to his two children,
and a ring of twenty shillings to his wife. Nicholas and Robert were
only left twenty-shilling rings, and the administration of the will was
entrusted to William Herrick and the Wingfields. The will may have been
the result of a family arrangement, and we have no reason to believe
that the unequal division gave rise to any ill-feeling. Herrick's
address to "his dying brother, Master William Herrick" (<a href="#p186">186</a>), shows
abundant affection, and there is every reason to believe that it was
addressed to the William who administered to Mrs. Herrick's will.</p>

<p>While little nephews and nieces were springing up around him, Herrick
remained unmarried, and frequently congratulates himself on his freedom
from the yoke matrimonial. He imagined how he would bid farewell to his
wife, if he had one (<a href="#p465">465</a>), and wrote magnificent epithalamia for his
friends, but lived and died a bachelor. When first civil troubles and
then civil war cast a shadow over the land, it is not very easy to say
how he viewed the contending parties. He was devoted to Charles and
Henrietta Maria and the young Prince of Wales, and rejoiced at every
Royalist success. Many also of his poems breathe the spirit of
unquestioning loyalty, but in others he is less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span> certain of kingly
wisdom. Something, however, must be allowed for his evident habit of
versifying any phrase or epigram which impressed him, and not all his
poems need be regarded as expressions of his personal opinions. But with
whatever doubts his loyalty was qualified, it was sufficiently obvious
to procure his ejection from his living in 1648; and, making the best of
his loss, he bade farewell to Dean Prior, shook the dust of "loathed
Devonshire" off his feet, and returned gaily to London, where he appears
to have discarded his clerical habit and to have been made abundantly
welcome by his friends.</p>

<p>Free from the cares of his incumbency, and free also from the restraints
it imposed, Herrick's thoughts turned to the publication of his poems.
As we have said, in his old Court-days these had found some circulation
in manuscript, and in 1635 one of his fairy poems was printed, probably
without his leave (see <a href="ii.html#Page_322">Appendix</a>). In 1639 his poem (<a href="ii.html#p575">575</a>) <i>The Apparition
of his Mistress calling him to Elysium</i> was licensed at Stationers' Hall
under the title of <i>His Mistress' Shade</i>, and it was included the next
year in an edition of Shakespeare's Poems (see <a href="ii.html#n575ii">Notes</a>). On April 29,
1640, "The severall poems written by Master Robert Herrick," were
entered as to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span> published by Andrew Crook, but no trace of such a
volume has been discovered, and it was only in 1648 that <i>Hesperides</i> at
length appeared. Two years later upwards of eighty of the poems in it
were printed in the 1650 edition of <i>Witt's Recreations</i>, but a small
number of these show considerable variations from the <i>Hesperides</i>
versions, and it is probable that they were printed from the poet's
manuscript. Compilers of other miscellanies and song books laid Herrick
under contribution, but, with the one exception of his contribution to
the <i>Lacrym&aelig; Musarum</i> in 1649, no fresh production of his pen has been
preserved, and we know nothing further of his life save that he returned
to Dean Prior after the Restoration (August 24, 1662), and that
according to the parish register "Robert Herrick, Vicker, was buried
y<sup>e</sup> 15th day October, 1674."</p>

<p>In this edition some trifling errors, which had crept into the text and
the numeration of the poems, have been corrected, and many fresh
illustrations of Herrick's reading added in the notes, which have
elsewhere been slightly compressed to make room for them. Almost all of
the new notes have been supplied from the manuscript collections of a
veteran student of Herrick who placed himself in correspondence with me
after the publication of my first edition. To my great regret I am not
allowed to make my acknowledgments to him by name.</p>

<span class="i0">Into the which who looks shall see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His temple of idolatry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where he of godheads has such store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Rome's pantheon had not more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His house of Rimmon this he calls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Girt with small bones instead of walls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First, in a niche, more black than jet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His idol-cricket there is set:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then in a polished oval by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There stands his idol-beetle-fly:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next in an arch, akin to this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His idol-canker seated is:<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then in a round is placed by these<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So that, where'er ye look, ye see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No capital, no cornice free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or frieze, from this fine frippery.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now this the fairies would have known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Theirs is a mixed religion:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some have heard the elves it call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Part pagan, part papistical.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If unto me all tongues were granted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could not speak the saints here painted.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saint Tit, Saint Nit, Saint Is, Saint Itis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who 'gainst Mab's-state placed here right is;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saint Will o' th' Wisp, of no great bigness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But <i>alias</i> called here <i>Fatuus ignis</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saint Frip, Saint Trip, Saint Fill, Saint Fillie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neither those other saintships will I<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Their number, almost infinite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which one by one here set down are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this most curious calendar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First, at the entrance of the gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little puppet-priest doth wait,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who squeaks to all the comers there:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i>Favour your tongues who enter here;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Pure hands bring hither without stain.</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A second pules: "<i>Hence, hence, profane!</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard by, i' th' shell of half a nut,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The holy-water there is put:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little brush of squirrel's hairs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Composed of odd, not even pairs,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stands in the platter, or close by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To purge the fairy family.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near to the altar stands the priest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There off'ring up the Holy Grist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ducking in mood and perfect tense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With (much-good-do-'t him) reverence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The altar is not here four-square,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor in a form triangular,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor made of glass, or wood, or stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of a little transverse bone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which boys and bruckel'd children call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Playing for points and pins) cockal.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose linen drapery is a thin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Subtile and ductile codlin's skin:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which o'er the board is smoothly spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With little seal-work damasked.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fringe that circumbinds it too<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is spangle-work of trembling dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, gently gleaming, makes a show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like frost-work glitt'ring on the snow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon this fetuous board doth stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something for show-bread, and at hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just in the middle of the altar,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Upon an end, the fairy-psalter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grac'd with the trout-flies' curious wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which serve for watchet ribbonings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, we must know, the elves are led<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right by the rubric which they read.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, if report of them be true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have their text for what they do;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aye, and their book of canons too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as Sir Thomas Parson tells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have their book of articles;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, if that fairy-knight not lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have their book of homilies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And other scriptures that design<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A short but righteous discipline.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The basin stands the board upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take the free oblation:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little pin-dust, which they hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More precious than we prize our gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which charity they give to many<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor of the parish, if there's any.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the ends of these neat rails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hatch'd with the silver-light of snails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The elves in formal manner fix<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two pure and holy candlesticks:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In either which a small tall bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burns for the altar's ornament.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For sanctity they have to these<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Their curious copes and surplices<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of cleanest cobweb hanging by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their religious vestery.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have their ash-pans and their brooms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To purge the chapel and the rooms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their many mumbling Mass-priests here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a dapper chorister,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their ush'ring vergers, here likewise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their canons and their chanteries.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of cloister-monks they have enow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aye, and their abbey-lubbers too;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, if their legend do not lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They much affect the papacy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And since the last is dead, there's hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Elf Boniface shall next be pope</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have their cups and chalices;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their pardons and indulgences;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their beads of nits, bells, books, and wax<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Candles, forsooth, and other knacks;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their holy oil, their fasting spittle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sacred salt here, not a little;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dry chips, old shoes, rags, grease and bones;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside their fumigations<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drive the devil from the cod-piece<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the friar (of work an odd piece).<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many a trifle, too, and trinket,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for what use, scarce man would think it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next, then, upon the chanters' side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An apple's core is hung up dri'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rattling kernels, which is rung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To call to morn and even-song.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>

involved in the use of the Latin <i>pupilla</i> (a little girl), or "pupil,"
for the central spot of the eye. The metaphor doubtless arose from the
small reflections of the inlooker, which appear in the eyes of the
person gazed at; but we meet with it both intensified, as in the phrase
"to look babies in the eyes" (= to peer amorously), and with its origin
disregarded, as in Herrick, where the "babies" are the pupils, and have
an existence independent of any inlooker.</p>

Thomas Fane, the first earl, in March, 1628. At the outbreak of the
Civil War he sided with the king, but after a short imprisonment made
his submission to the Parliament, and was relieved of the sequestration
of his estates.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> He subsequently printed privately a volume of poems,
called <i>Otia Sacra</i>, which has been re-edited by Dr. Grosart.</p>

<p><a name="n117i" id="n117i"></a><a href="#p117">117</a>. <i>To the Patron of Poets, M. End. Porter.</i> Five of Herrick's poems
are addressed to Endymion Porter, who seems to have been looked to as a
patron by all the singers of his day. According to the inscription on a
medal of him executed by Varin in 1635, he was then forty-eight, so that
he was born in 1587, coming into the world at Aston-under-Hill in
Gloucestershire. He went with Charles on his trip to Spain, and after
his accession became groom of his bedchamber, was active in the king's
service during the Civil War, and died in 1649. He was a collector of
works of art both for himself and for the king, and encouraged Rob.
Dover's Cotswold games by presenting him with a suit of the king's
clothes. &Agrave; Wood tells us this, and mentions also that he was a friend of
Donne, that Gervase Warmsely dedicated his <i>Virescit Vulnere Virtus</i> to
him in 1628, and that in conjunction with the Earl of St. Alban's he
also received the dedication of Davenant's <i>Madagascar</i>.</p>

themselves distinguished. Cp. Juvenal, vii. 94.</p>

Nothing is known of him, but I find in the Oxford Register that a John

(1582-1650), Bishop of Lincoln, 1621; Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal,
1621-1625; suspended and imprisoned, 1637-1640, on a frivolous charge of
having betrayed the king's secrets; Archbishop of York, 1641. Save from
this poem and the <i>Carol</i> printed in the Appendix we know nothing of his
relations with Herrick. He had probably stood in the way of the poet's
obtaining holy orders or preferment. When Herrick was appointed to the
cure of Dean Prior in 1629, Williams had already lost favour at the
Court.</p>

<p><i>O'er the threshold force her in.</i> The custom of lifting the bride over
the threshold, probably to avert an ill-omened stumble, has prevailed
among the most diverse races. For the anointing of the doorposts Brand
quotes Langley's translation of Polydore Vergil: "The bryde anoynted the
poostes of the doores with swynes' grease, because she thought by that
meanes to dryve awaye all misfortune, whereof she had her name in Latin
'Uxor ab unguendo'".</p>

<p><i>To gather nuts.</i> A Roman marriage custom mentioned in Catullus, <i>Carm.</i>

mind all through this ode.</p>

<p><i>With all lucky birds to side.</i> Bona cum bona nubit alite virgo. Cat.

<p><i>But when ye both can say Come.</i> The wish in this case appears to have

<p><a href="#p185">185</a>. <i>An Ode to Master Endymion Porter, upon his brother's death.</i>
Endymion Porter is said to have had an only brother, Giles, who died in
the king's service at Oxford, <i>i.e.</i>, between 1642 and 1646, and it has
been taken for granted that this ode refers to his death. The
supposition is possibly right, but if so, the ode, despite its beauty,
is so gratingly and extraordinarily selfish that we may wonder if the
dead brother is not the William Herrick of the next poem. The first
verse is, of course, a soliloquy of Herrick's, not, as Dr. Grosart
suggests, addressed to him by Porter. Dr. Nott again parallels Catullus,
<i>Carm</i>. v.</p>

<p><a href="#p186">186</a>. <i>To his dying brother, Master William Herrick.</i> According to Dr.
Grosart and Mr. Hazlitt the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> poet had an elder brother, William,
baptized at St. Vedast's, Foster Lane, Nov. 24, 1585 (he must have been
born some months earlier, if this date be right, for his sister Martha
was baptized in the following January), and alive in 1629, when he acted
as one of the executors of his mother's will. But, it is said, there was
also another brother named William, born in 1593, after his father's
death, "at Harry Campion's house at Hampton". I have not been able to
find the authority for this last statement, which, as it asserts the
co-existence of two brothers, of the same name, is certainly surprising.
According to Dr. Grosart, it is the younger William who "died young" and
was addressed in this poem, but I must own to feeling some doubt in the
matter.</p>

in all important points. We may conclude, therefore, that they represent
an earlier version of the poem, subsequently revised by Herrick before
the issue of <i>Hesperides</i>. In the subjoined copy, in which the two MSS.

king's troop of guards, and was killed at the battle of Rowton Heath,
outside Chester, Sept. 24, 1645.</p>

<p>Clarendon (<i>History of the Rebellion</i>, ix. 19) thus records his death
and character: "Here fell many gentlemen and officers of name, with the
brave Earl of Litchfield, who was the third brother of that illustrious
family that sacrificed his life in this quarrel. He was a very faultless
young man, of a most gentle, courteous, and affable nature, and of a
spirit and courage invincible; whose loss all men lamented, and the king
bore it with extraordinary grief."</p>

<p><i>Trentall.</i> Properly a set of thirty masses for the repose of a dead
man's soul. Here and elsewhere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> Herrick uses the word as an equivalent
for dirge, but Sidney distinguished them: "Let dirige be sung and
trentalls rightly read. For love is dead," etc. "Hence, hence profane,"
is the Latin, <i>procul o procul este profani</i> of Virg. <i>&AElig;n.</i> vi. 258,
where "profane" is only equivalent to uninitiated.</p>

<p><a name="n223i" id="n223i"></a><a href="#p223">223</a>. <i>The Fairy Temple.</i> For a brief note on Herrick's fairy poems, see
Appendix. On the dedication to Mr. John Merrifield, Counsellor-at-Law,
Dr. Grosart remarks: "Nothing seems to be now known of Merrifield. It is
just possible that&mdash;as throughout the poem&mdash;the name was an invented
one, 'Merry Field'." But the records of the Inner Temple show that the
Merrifields were a legal family from Woolmiston, near Crewkerne,
Somersetshire. John (son of Richard) Merrifield, the father, was
admitted to the Inner Temple in 1581, and John, the son, in 1611. This
latter must be Herrick's Counsellor. He rose to be a Master of the Bench
in 1638 and Sergeant-at-Law in 1660. He died October, 1666, aged 75, at
Crewkerne. On the other hand, it can hardly be doubted that Dr. Grosart
is right in regarding the names of the fairy saints as quite imaginary.
He nevertheless suggests SS. Titus, Neot, Idus, Ida, Fridian or
Fridolin, Trypho, Felan and Felix as the possible prototypes of "Saint
<i>Tit</i>, Saint <i>Nit</i>, Saint <i>Is</i>," etc. It should be noted that "Tit and
Nit" occur with "Wap and Win" and other obviously made-up names, in
Drayton's <i>Nymphidia</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#p283">283</a>. <i>A Nuptial Song on Sir Clipseby Crew.</i> Of this Epithalamium
(written in 1625 for the marriage of Sir Clipseby Crew, knighted by
James I. at Theobald's in 1620, with Jane, daughter of Sir John
Pulteney), two manuscript versions, substantially agreeing, are
preserved at the British Museum (Harl. MS. 6917, and Add. 25, 303).
Seven verses are transcribed in these manuscripts which Herrick
afterwards saw fit to omit, and almost every verse contains variants of
importance. It is impossible to convey the effect of the earlier version
by a mere collation, and I therefore transcribe it in full, despite its
length. As before, variants and additions are printed in italics. The
numbers in brackets are those of the later version, as given in
<i>Hesperides</i>. The marginal readings are variants of Add. 25, 303, from
the Harleian manuscript.</p>

<p>The variants in this version are not very important; one of the most
noteworthy, <i>round</i> for <i>ground</i>, in stanza 5 [4], was overlooked by Dr.
Grosart in his collation. Of the seven stanzas subsequently omitted
several are of great beauty. There are few happier images in Herrick
than that of <i>Time throned in a saffron evening</i> in stanza 11. It is
only when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> the earlier version is read as a whole that Herrick's taste
in omitting is vindicated. Each stanza is good in itself, but in the
MSS. the poem drags from excessive length, and the reduction of its
twenty-three stanzas to sixteen greatly improves it.</p>

<p>The Shapcott to whom this <i>Oberon's Feast</i> and <i>Oberon's Palace</i> are
dedicated is Herrick's "peculiar friend, Master Thomas Shapcott,
Lawyer," of a later poem. Dr. Grosart again suggests that it may have
been a character-name, but, as in the case of John Merrifield, the owner
was a West country-man and a member of the Inner Temple, where he was
admitted in 1632 as the "son and heir of Thomas Shapcott," of Exeter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#p301">301</a>. <i>Master Edward Norgate, Clerk of the Signet of his Majesty:</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>Son to Robert Norgate, D.D., Master of Bene't College, Cambridge. He was
employed by the Earl of Arundel to purchase pictures, and on one
occasion found himself at Marseilles without remittances, and had to
tramp through France on foot. According to the Calendars of State Papers
in 1625, it was ordered that, "forasmuch as his Majesty's letters to the
Grand Signior, the King of Persia, the Emperor of Russia, the Great
Mogul, and other remote Princes, had been written, limned, and garnished
with gold and colours by scriveners abroad, thenceforth they should be
so written, limned, and garnished by Edward Norgate, Clerk of the Signet
in reversion". Six years later this order was renewed, the "Kings of
Bantam, Macassar, Barbary, Siam, Achine, Fez, and Sus" being added to
the previous list, and Norgate being now designated as a Clerk of the
Signet Extraordinary. In the same year, having previously been
Bluemantle Pursuivant, he was promoted to be Windsor Herald, in which
capacity he received numerous fees during the next few years, and was
excused ship money. He still, however, retained his clerkship, for he
writes in 1639: "The poor Office of Arms is fain to blazon the Council
books and Signet". The phrase<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span> occurs in a series of nineteen letters of
extraordinary interest, which Norgate wrote from the North, chiefly to
his friend, Robert Reade, secretary to Windebank, on the course of
affairs. In Sept., 1641, "Ned Norgate" was ordered personally to attend
the king. "It is his Majesty's pleasure that the master should wait and
not the men, and <i>that</i> they shall find." Henceforth I find no certain
reference to him; according to Fuller he died at the Herald's Office in
1649. It would be interesting if we could be sure that this Edward
Norgate is the same as the one who in 1611 was appointed Tuner of his
Majesty's "virginals, organs, and other instruments," and in 1637
received a grant of &pound;140 for the repair of the organ at Hampton Court.
Herrick's love of music makes us expect to find a similar trait in his
friends.</p>

<p><a href="#p313">313</a>. <i>The Entertainment, or Porch Verse.</i> The words <i>Ye wrong the
threshold-god</i> and the allusion to the porch in the Clipsby Crew
Epithalamium (stanza 4) show that there is no reference here (as Brand
thinks, ii. 135) to the old custom of reading part of the marriage
service at the church door or porch (cp. Chaucer: "Husbands at church&euml;
door she had had five"). The porch of the house is meant, and the
allusions are to the ceremonies at the threshold (cp. the Southwell
Epithalamium). Dr. Grosart quotes from the Dean Prior register the entry
of the marriage of Henry Northleigh, gentleman, and Mistress Lettice
Yard on September 5, 1639, by licence from the Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

edition of the <i>Diary of Walter Yonge</i>, p. 70 (kindly shown me by the
Rev. J. H. Ward), we have a contemporary account of the Club known as
the Tityre Tues, which took its name from the first words of Virgil's
first <i>Eclogue</i>. "The beginning of December, 1623, there was a great
number in London, haunting taverns and other debauched places, who swore
themselves in a brotherhood and named themselves <i>Tityre Tues</i>. The oath
they gave in this manner: he that was to be sworn did put his dagger
into a pottle of wine, and held his hand upon the pommel thereof, and
then was to make oath that he would aid and assist all other of his
fellowship and not disclose their council. There were divers knights,
some young noblemen and gentlemen of this brotherhood, and they were to
know one the other by a black bugle which they wore, and their followers
to be known by a blue ribbond. There are discovered of them about 80 or
100 persons, and have been examined by the Privy Council, but nothing
discovered of any intent they had. It is said that the king hath given
commandment that they shall be re-examined." In Mennis's <i>Musarum
Delici&aelig;</i> the brotherhood is celebrated in a poem headed "The Tytre Tues;
or, a Mocke Song. To the tune of Chive Chase. By Mr. George Chambers."
The second verse runs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"They call themselves the Tytere-tues,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And wore a blue rib-bin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when a-drie would not refuse<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To drink. O fearful sin!<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The council, which is thought most wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Did sit so long upon it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they grew weary and did rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And could make nothing on it."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>According to a letter of Chamberlain to Carleton, indexed among the
<i>State Papers</i>, the Tityres were a secret society first formed in Lord
Vaux's regiment in the Low Countries, and their "prince" was called
Ottoman. Another entry shows that the "Bugle" mentioned by Yonge was the
badge of a society originally distinct from the Tityres, which
afterwards joined with it. The date of Herrick's poem is thus fixed as
December, 162&frac34;, and this is confirmed by another sentence in the same
passage in <i>Yonge's Diary</i>, in which he says: "The Jesuits and Papists
do wonderfully swarm in the city, and rumours lately have been given out
for firing the Navy and House of Munition, on which are set a double
guard". The Parliament to which Herrick alludes was actually summoned in
January, 1624, to meet on February 12. Sir Simeon Steward, to whom the
poem is addressed, was of the family of the Stewards of Stantney, in the
Isle of Ely. He was knighted with his father, Mark Steward, in 1603, and
afterwards became a fellow-commoner of Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He was
at different times Sheriff and Deputy-Lieutenant for Cambridgeshire, and
while serving in the latter capacity got into some trouble for unlawful
exactions. In 1627 he wrote a poem on the <i>King of the Fairies Clothes</i>
in the same vein as Herrick's fairy pieces.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#p321">321</a>. <i>Then is the work half done.</i> As Dr. Grosart suggests, Herrick may
have had in mind the "Dimidium facti qui c&#339;pit habet" of Horace, I.
<i>Epist.</i> ii. 40. But here the emphasis is on beginning <i>well</i>, there on
<i>beginning</i>.</p>

<p><i>Begin with Jove</i> is doubtless from the "Ab Jove principium, Mus&aelig;," of
Virg. <i>Ecl.</i> iii. 60.</p>

<p><a href="#p323">323</a>. <i>Fears not the fierce sedition of the seas.</i> A reminiscence of
Horace, III. <i>Od.</i> i. 25-32.</p>

<p><a href="#p328">328</a>. <i>Gold before goodness.</i> Printed in <i>Witts Recreations</i>, 1650, as <i>A
Foolish Querie</i>. The sentiment is from Seneca, <i>Ep.</i> cxv.: An dives,
omnes qu&aelig;rimus; nemo, an bonus. Cp. Juvenal, III. 140 sqq.; Plaut.
<i>Men&aelig;chm.</i> IV. ii. 6.</p>

<p><a href="#p331">331</a>. <i>To his honoured kinsman, Sir William Soame.</i> The second son of Sir
Stephen Soame, Lord Mayor of London in 1598. Herrick's father and Sir
Stephen married sisters.</p>

<p><i>As benjamin and storax when they meet.</i> Instances of the use of
"Benjamin" for gum benzoin will be found in the Dictionaries. Dr.
Grosart's gloss, "<i>Benjamin</i>, the favourite youngest son of the
Patriarch," is unfortunate.</p>

2725, where it is entitled <i>Mr. Herrick's Old Age to Mr. Weekes</i>. I do
not think it has been collated before. Stanzas i.-vi. contain few
variants; ii. 6 reads: "Dislikes to care for what's behind"; iii. 6:
"Like a lost maidenhead," for "Like to a lily lost"; v. 8: "With the
best and whitest stone"; vi. 1: "We'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> not be poor". After this we have

<p>Stanza vii., l. 2, has "close" for "both"; l. 3 "see" for "have"; l. 6,
"open" for "that cheap"; l. 7, "full" for "same". Stanzas x.-xvii. have
so many variants that I am obliged to transcribe them in full, though

<p>This John Wickes or Weekes is spoken of by Anthony &agrave; Wood as a "jocular
person" and a popular preacher. He enters Wood's <i>Fasti</i> by right of his
co-optation as a D.D. in 1643, while the court was at Oxford; his
education had been at Cambridge. He was a prebendary of Bristol and Dean
of St. Burian in Cornwall, and suffered some persecution as a royalist.
Herrick later on, when himself shedless and cottageless, addresses
another poem to him as his "peculiar friend,"</p>

<p>A friend suggests that Hind may have been John Hind, an Anacreontic poet
and friend of Greene, and has found references to a Thomas Goodricke of
St. John's Coll., Camb., author of two poems on the accession of James
I., and a Martin Nansogge, B.A. of Trinity Hall, 1614, afterwards vicar
of Cornwood, Devon. Smith is certainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> James Smith, who, with Sir John

<p>The early part of this poem contains, along with the name Posthumus,
many Horatian reminiscences: cp. especially II. <i>Od.</i> xiv. 1-8, and IV.
<i>Od.</i> vii. 14. It may be noted that in the imitation of the latter

<p>Again the variant, "<i>Open</i> candle baudery," in verse 7, is an additional
argument against Dr. Grosart's explanation: "Obscene words and figures
made with candle-smoke," the allusion being merely to the blackened
ceilings produced by cheap candles without a shade.</p>

to whom the Shakespeare folio of 1623 was dedicated, and he was a good

may, or may not, be considered as further evidence of a respect for

<p><i>But great and large she spreads by dust and sweat.</i> Dr. Grosart very
appositely quotes Montaigne: "For it seemeth that the verie name of

well exercise it selfe without an enemie" (Florio's tr., p. 233). But I
think the two passages have a common origin in some version of Hesiod's

<p><a href="#p392">392</a>. <i>Sir Edward Fish, Knight Baronet</i>, of Chertsey, in Surrey. Died
1658.</p>

<p><a name="n405i" id="n405i"></a><a href="#p405">405</a>. <i>Nor fear or spice or fish.</i> Herrick is remembering Persius, i. 43:
Nec scombros metuentia carmina, nec thus. To form the paper jacket or

the ultimate employment of many poems. Cp. Mart. III. l. 9; IV. lxxxvii.

<p><i>The farting Tanner and familiar King.</i> The ballad here alluded to is
that of <i>King Edward IV. and the tanner of Tamworth</i>, printed in Prof.
Child's collection. "The dancing friar tattered in the bush" of the next
line is one of the heroes of the old ballad of <i>The Fryar and the Boye</i>,
printed by Wynkyn de Worde, and included in the Appendix to Furnivall
and Hales' edition of the Percy folio. The boy was the possessor of a
"magic flute," and, having got the friar into a bush, made him dance
there.</p>

<p>"Those monstrous lies of little Robin Rush" is explained by Dr. Grosart
as an allusion to "The Historie of Friar Rush, how he came to a House of
Religion to seek a Service, and being entertained by the Prior was made
First Cook, being full of pleasant Mirth and Delight for young people".
Of "Tom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span> Chipperfield and pretty lisping Ned" I can find nothing. "The
flying Pilchard and the frisking Dace" probably belong to the fish
monsters alluded to in the <i>Tempest</i>. In "Tim Trundell" Herrick seems
for the sake of alliteration to have taken a liberty with the Christian
name of a well-known ballad publisher.</p>

which I have collated, and Ashmole MS. 38, which I only know through my

unite in increasing our knowledge of Herrick by a passage of
twenty-seven lines, following on the words "And here and there and
farther off," and in lieu of the next four and a half lines in
<i>Hesperides</i>. They read as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>The italicised words in the last few lines appear in <i>Hesperides</i>; all
the rest are new. Other variants are: "The grass of Lemster ore soberly
sparkling" for "the finest Lemster ore mildly disparkling"; "girdle" for
"ceston"; "The eyes of all doth strait bewitch" for "All with temptation
doth bewitch"; "choicely hung" for "neatly hung"; "silver roach" for
"silvery fish"; "cave" for "room"; "get reflection" for "make
reflected"; "Candlemas" for "taper-light"; "moon-tane" for
"moon-tanned," etc., etc.</p>

<p><a href="#p451">451</a>. <i>To the right gracious Prince, Lodowick, Duke of Richmond and
Lennox.</i> There appears to me to be a blunder here which Dr. Grosart and
Mr. Hazlitt do not elucidate, by recording the birth of Lodowick, first
Duke of Richmond, in 1574, his succession to the Lennox title in 1583,
creation as Duke of Richmond in May, 1623, and death in the following
February. For this first duke was no "stem" left "of all those three
brave brothers fallen in the war," and the allusion here is undoubtedly
to his nephews&mdash;George, Lord d'Aubigny, who fell at Edgehill; Lord John
Stewart, who fell at Alresford; and Lord Bernard Stewart (Earl of
Lichfield), who fell at Rowton Heath. In elucidation of Herrick's Dirge
(<a href="#p219">219</a>) over the last of these three brothers, I have already quoted
Clarendon's remark, that he was "the third brother of that illustrious
family that sacrificed his life in this quarrel," and it cannot be
doubted that Herrick is here alluding to the same fact. The poem must
therefore have been written after 1645, <i>i.e.</i>, more than twenty years
after the death of Duke Lodowick. But the duke then living was James,
who succeeded his father Esme in 1624, was recreated Duke of Richmond in
1641, and did not die till 1655. It is true that there was a brother
named Lodovic, but he was an abbot in France and never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span> succeeded to the
title. Herrick, therefore, seems to have blundered in the Christian
name.</p>

certain Robert Herrick married at St. Clement Danes, 1632, to a Jane
Gibbons. The variants are numerous, but not very important. In l. 4 we
have "draw wooers" for "draw thousands"; ll. 11-16 are transposed to

some small words throws some light on a change in Herrick's metrical
views as he grew older. The words omitted are bracketed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"[And] Let thy dreams be only fed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With this, that I am in thy bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And [thou] then turning in that sphere,<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>'Gainst thee and</i> force a passage in," etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Other variants are: "Creates the action" for "That makes the action";
"Glory" for "Triumph"; "my last signet" for "this compression"; "turn
again in my full triumph" for "come again, As one triumphant," and "the
height of womankind" for "all faith of womankind".</p>

<p><i>The body sins not, 'tis the will</i>, etc. A maxim of law Latin: Actus non
facit reum nisi mens sit rea.</p>

<p><a href="#p466">466</a>. <i>To his Kinsman, Sir Thos. Soame</i>, son of Sir Stephen Soame, Lord
Mayor of London, 1589, and of Anne Stone, Herrick's aunt. Sir Thomas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
was Sheriff of London, 1635, M.P. for the City, 1640, and died Jan.,
1670. See Cussan's <i>Hertfortshire</i>. (<i>Hundred of Edwinstree</i>, p. 100.)</p>

<p><a href="#p470">470</a>. <i>Few Fortunate.</i> A variant on the text (Matt. xx. 16): "Many be
called but few chosen".</p>

<p><a name="n479i" id="n479i"></a><a href="#p479">479</a>. <i>To Rosemary and Bays.</i> The use of rosemary and bays at weddings
forms a section in Brand's chapter on marriage customs (ii. 119). For
the gilding he quotes from a wedding sermon preached in 1607 by Roger
Hacket: "Smell sweet, O ye flowers, in your native sweetness: be not
gilded with the idle art of man". The use of gloves at weddings forms
the subject of another section in Brand (ii. 125). He quotes Ben
Jonson's <i>Silent Woman</i>; "We see no ensigns of a wedding here, no
character of a bridal; where be our scarves and our gloves?"</p>

<p><a href="#p483">483</a>. <i>To his worthy friend, M. Thomas Falconbrige.</i> As Herrick hints at
his friend's destiny for a public career, it seemed worth while to hunt
through the Calendar of State Papers for a chance reference to this
Falconbridge, who so far has evaded editors. He is apparently the Mr.
Thomas Falconbridge who appears in various papers between 1640 and 1644,
as passing accounts, and in the latter year was "Receiver-General at
Westminster".</p>

<p><i>He rents his crown that fears the people's hate.</i> Also from Seneca,

<p><a name="n496i" id="n496i"></a><a href="#p496">496</a>. <i>To his honoured kinsman, Sir Richard Stone</i>, son of John Stone,
sergeant-at-law, the brother of Julian Stone, Herrick's mother. He died
in 1660.</p>

<p><i>To this white temple of my heroes.</i> Ben Jonson's admirers were proud to
call themselves "sealed of the tribe of Ben," and Herrick, a devout
Jonsonite, seems to have imitated the idea so far as to plan sometimes,
as here, a Temple, sometimes a Book (see <i>infra</i>, <a href="#p510">510</a>), sometimes a City
(<a href="#p365">365</a>), a Plantation (<a href="#p392">392</a>), a Calendar (<a href="#p545">545</a>), a College (<a href="ii.html#p983">983</a>), of his own
favourite friends, to whom his poetry was to give immortality. The
earliest direct reference to this plan is in his address to John Selden,
the antiquary (<a href="#p365">365</a>), in which he writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A city here of heroes I have made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the rock whose firm foundation laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall never shrink; where, making thine abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live thou a Selden, that's a demi-god".<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is noteworthy that the poems which contain the clearest reference to
this Temple (or its variants) are mostly addressed to kinsfolk, <i>e.g.</i>,
this to Sir Richard Stone, to Mrs. Penelope Wheeler, to Mr. Stephen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
Soame, and to Susanna and Thomas Herrick. Other recipients of the honour
are Sir Edward Fish and Dr. Alabaster, Jack Crofts, Master J. Jincks,
etc.</p>

<p><a name="n500i" id="n500i"></a><a href="#p500">500</a>. <i>To Mistress Dorothy Parsons.</i> This "saint" from Herrick's Temple
may certainly be identified with the second of the three children
(William, Dorothy, and Thomasine) of Mr. John Parsons, organist and
master of the choristers at Westminster Abbey, where he was buried in
1623. Herrick addresses another poem to her sister Thomasine:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And be of all admired, Thomasine".<br /></span>

<p><a href="#p511">511</a>. <i>A mighty strife 'twixt form and chastity.</i> Lis est cum form&acirc; magna
pudiciti&aelig;. Quoted from Ovid by Burton, who translates: "Beauty and
honesty have ever been at odds".</p>

<p><a href="#p514">514</a>. <i>To the Lady Crew, upon the death of her child.</i> This must be the
child buried in Westminster Abbey, according to the entry in the
register "163&#8542;, Feb. 6. Sir Clipsy Crewe's daughter, in the North
aisle of the monuments." Colonel Chester annotates: "She was a younger
daughter, and was born at Crewe, 27th July, 1631. She died on the 4th of
February, and must have been an independent heiress, as her father
administered to her estate on the 24th May following."</p>

<p><a href="#p515">515</a>. <i>Here needs no Court for our Request.</i> An allusion to the Court of
Requests, established in the time of Richard II. as a lesser Court of
Equity for the hearing of "all poor men's suits". It was abolished in
1641, at the same time as the Star Chamber.</p>
